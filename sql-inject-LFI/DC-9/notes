1. nmap scan of the box: 
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
|_http-title: Example.com - Staff Details - Welcome

only seeing 80 is open

2. checking out the example site. 
Standard example site, and search seems to be the most interesting page. 

3. run a gobuster against the site. 
gobuster dir -u http://10.0.2.4 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php -o gobuster-main.out

dir == setting gobuster to use directory mode 
-x == add extension (php in this example because the site is showing it)
-o == output results to a file 

Results in gobuster-main.out

4. Send requests to burp
